# Discord bot privacy policy of [Vysion#8034](https://discord.com/users/1185987360018665523)

1) **What data does this bot store?**

- Guild IDs
- Channel IDs
- User IDs

2) **Why do we need the data, and why do we use this data?**

    a) Guild IDs' are stored for configuration settings (e.g. ticket system).

    b) Channel IDs' are also stored for configuration settings (e.g ticket system).
    
    c) User IDs' are also stored for configuration settings (e.g. for the mini-game "Speedgame", better known as "10 Seconds"). When playing, the Discord user ID of the player is stored in a database with the best time in the game. This is necessary, for example, to create a /leaderboard command. The bot then looks into the database and picks out the 10 best users in the speed game in order to list them with their respective best time in the Discord embed.

3) **Other than Discord, do we share your data with any 3rd parties?**
No, we do not share data with any 3rd parties!

4) **How can users get data removed, or how can users contact the bot owner?**
To have your data removed, or to contact the Discord bot developer, you can send me ([@max1385](https://discord.com/users/770636457043034112)) a friend request or a DM on Discord (maybe my DMs are sometimes closed, but you can still send me a friend request)!
