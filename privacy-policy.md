# Discord bot privacy policy of [Vysion#8034](https://discord.com/users/1185987360018665523)

1) **What data does this bot store?**

- Guild IDs
- Channel IDs
- User IDs

2) **Why do we need the data, and why do we use this data?**

    a) Guild IDs' are stored for configuration settings (e.g. ticket system).

    b) Channel IDs' are also stored for configuration settings (e.g ticket system).
    
    c) User IDs' are also stored for configuration settings (e.g. for the mini-game "Speedgame", better known as "10 Seconds"). When playing, the Discord user ID of the player is stored in a database with the best time in the game. This is necessary, for example, to create a /leaderboard command. The bot then looks into the database and picks out the 10 best users in the speed game in order to list them with their respective best time in the Discord embed.

3) **Other than Discord, do we share your data with any 3rd parties?**
No, we do not share data with any 3rd parties!

4) **How can users get data removed, or how can users contact the bot owner?**
- Our bot is programmed to delete all your server data when the bot is removed from the server. The data retention time is therefore only when the bot is actively used on the discord server. If you still want to delete any data, see the following instructions:
- A deletion of the data can be requested at any time by contacting us. Please note that a deletion of the data can take up to 30 days. You can contact us on our [Discord Support Server](https://neon.ly/vysion-support) to request a Deletion of Data. There is a channel called support-ticket where you can submit your request for data deletion.
